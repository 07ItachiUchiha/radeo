# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies, including:
- React and React DOM
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation
- Three.js and related libraries for 3D effects
- Axios for API requests
- React Intersection Observer for scroll animations

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
